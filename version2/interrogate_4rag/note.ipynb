    "The user submits a query in natural language (**User Input**). The query processing system (**query_dataframe**) receives the query and calls the question-answering chain (**create_qa_chain**) for processing. The question-answering chain (**create_qa_chain**) retrieves relevant information from the vector store (**setup_vectorstore**), invokes the LLM to generate an answer, and returns the result to the query processing system (**query_dataframe**). The query processing system (**query_dataframe**) processes the answer (executes pandas code based on the generated code) and sends the result to the result display system (**display_query_result**). Finally, the result display system (**display_query_result**) formats the output and presents it to the user for easy viewing.\n",

    "This RAG system is built using the LangChain framework, an open-source framework designed for building and deploying applications powered by language models. LangChain provides a suite of tools and components for processing and interacting with language models, making it suitable for a variety of natural language processing tasks such as question answering, conversational systems, text generation, and more.\n",

    "LangChain offers a modular framework, enabling independent development and testing of different components (e.g., document retrieval, LLM calls, output parsing). This modular design simplifies system maintenance and enhances scalability. Additionally, LangChain allows users to choose from various LLMs, embedding models, and retrievers based on their specific needs. This flexibility enables developers to select the most suitable components for their use cases and datasets, thereby improving system performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, LangChain provides a simplified API that enables developers to rapidly build complex workflows. Through chain-based invocation, developers can seamlessly connect multiple processing steps, creating a comprehensive query handling pipeline.\n",

This approach forces the LLM to generate and output responses in a specified direction, making the system’s answers more standardized and stable. (Through multiple tests with different prompt templates, I found that the content of the prompt significantly impacts the system's final output. Detailed and clear instructions greatly improve the accuracy and stability of the results.) The text template is then converted into a LangChain `PromptTemplate` object for structured input management, with two input variables defined: context and question, to prevent omissions or incorrect inputs.\n",

This retriever uses similarity search to return the 3 most relevant documents for each query. This step is the core of the RAG architecture. With similarity searching via the vector database, it quickly retrieves the documents most relevant to the user's query. I chose the top 3 relevant documents to provide sufficient context while avoiding information overload, ensuring that the LLM receives accurate context information and improving the relevance and accuracy of the generated results.\n",

    "- **Functionality**: Verify if the system can accurately interpret natural language queries and perform the corresponding DataFrame operations.\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Ensure that the generated Pandas code aligns with the query intent and returns correct results.\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Assess the system's performance under boundary conditions and abnormal inputs.\n",
    "- **Readability**: Evaluate whether the output format of the responses is clearly structured and easy for users to understand.\n",

    "##### 3.2.1.2. Test Dimension Categorization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Functional Test Dimensions** (to evaluate system functionality and accuracy):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic Operations**: Querying basic information such as the number of rows, columns, column names, etc.\n",
    "- **Data Quality Checks**: Querying for missing values or duplicate data.\n",
    "- **Filtering and Grouping Operations**: Queries that involve conditional filtering or grouping and aggregation.\n",
    "- **Inter-column Relationships**: Queries related to correlation information between numerical columns.\n",
    "- **Statistical Analysis**: Queries for summary statistics, maximum, minimum, median values of numerical columns, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Robustness Test Dimensions** (to evaluate system robustness and readability):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clarity of Natural Language Input**: Compare the system's responses to well-defined and ambiguous queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *Well-defined queries*: Precisely specify column names in the DataFrame, allowing answers to be directly derived using queries or Pandas operations. Questions use standard statistical terminology.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - *Ambiguous queries*: Do not specify exact column names in the DataFrame, use synonyms or abbreviations, and require the system to infer answers by making comprehensive judgments. Questions use vague statistical terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complexity of Natural Language Input**: Compare the system's responses to simple and complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *Simple queries*: Involve single columns, with answers being a single value.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - *Complex queries*: Combine multiple columns for calculations, with answers potentially involving multiple rows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling of Abnormal Input**: Evaluate the system's behavior when users ask unrelated questions or make spelling mistakes in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.2.1.3. Test Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functionality Pass Rate**: At least 90% of the test cases must pass.\n",
    "- **Accuracy Requirements**: Query results must match manually computed results.\n",
    "- **Robustness**:\n",
    "  - a. The system must not crash under abnormal inputs and should provide clear error messages.\n",
    "  - b. When questions are ambiguous, involve complex operations, or contain minor spelling errors, the system should handle them correctly and return appropriate results.\n",

    "### 3.3. Test Results Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the various test results in Section 3.2.2, we can conduct the following analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analysis of Functional Test Case Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of the tests, the questions asked were relatively basic and clear. The system was generally able to accurately interpret the natural language queries, perform the corresponding DataFrame operations, and return results consistent with expectations. This indicates that the system's basic functionality and accuracy are satisfactory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analysis of Robustness Test Case Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of this section show that the system is capable of handling more complex queries and returning expected results. It can also intelligently recognize minor spelling errors and provide reasonable answers. For unrelated questions, the system appropriately responds with \"none\" or \"I don’t know\" instead of crashing or returning irrelevant incorrect results. This demonstrates that the system's robustness is adequate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the system's output format is consistent and stable, and in cases of errors, it provides specific error messages. This indicates that the system's result readability is satisfactory.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the system's ability to handle ambiguous queries is still lacking. For some ambiguous queries, the system may fail to correctly interpret the user's intent, leading to incorrect identification of column names. This results in either erroneous output during code execution or errors due to missing corresponding columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis of Output Stability**\n",
    "\n",
    "In both functional and robustness tests, certain queries yielded inconsistent output results when asked multiple times. While the majority of the outputs were correct, there were occasional instances where incorrect results were produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analysis of System Accuracy**\n",
    "   \n",
    "After initializing the runtime environment, the system's accuracy is slightly lower. However, as the number of executions increases, the system's stability and accuracy improve. This reflects the system's ongoing learning and optimization process.\n"

    "The `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` is a tool developed by the LangChain team to simplify operations on Pandas DataFrames. This agent can interpret natural language queries from users and convert them into corresponding Pandas operations, enabling data analysis and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the agent is capable of translating user queries into various Pandas operations and automatically generating Pandas code to retrieve and return analytical results, it does have some limitations. For example, it relies on the ability to execute arbitrary code, which may pose security risks, especially when handling untrusted inputs. In such cases, it is recommended to use it within a sandbox environment to mitigate potential risks. Additionally, performance bottlenecks may occur when processing large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of using `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` for natural language queries. When creating the agent, the parameter `allow_dangerous_code=True` must be specified to successfully initialize it. In this example, we use the same dataset as the RAG system described in this article and ask three very simple questions. The execution time for these queries varies: the first question is relatively quick, taking around 30 seconds, while the other two take over 1 minute each. In contrast, the RAG system designed in this article processes the same queries in less than 10 seconds each.For slightly more complex queries, there is a high likelihood of parsing errors."

    "## 5. Problems and Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this system has certain advantages over the agent-based solution, there are still some problems that need to be addressed and improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The system's main bottlenecks are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insufficient handling of ambiguous queries**: The system struggles to accurately understand the user's intent for certain ambiguous queries and fails to correctly identify the corresponding column names. This results in errors during code execution or failure to find the relevant columns, leading to inaccurate results and affecting user trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instability in output results**: For repeated queries on the same question, there are occasional inconsistencies in the output. While most of the time the outputs are correct, there are instances where incorrect results are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unnecessary Python code execution**: The system attempts to execute Python code unnecessarily even when the information can be directly retrieved from the vector database. This operation is redundant and often unsuccessful. Improvements are needed to enhance the `query_dataframe` function to avoid such unnecessary actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Addressing ambiguous queries and output instability**: Experiment with different LLMs and embedding models to evaluate their performance in resolving these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimizing the `query_dataframe` function**: Refine the function to filter out and prevent unnecessary Python code execution when the required information can be directly retrieved from the vector storage database.\n"
